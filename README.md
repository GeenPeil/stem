### I would like to participate

Awesome! Go to [Projects](https://github.com/GeenPeil/stem/projects) to find
yourself a suiting task to complete.

Once you've found a task you are willing to take on it's important to assign 
yourself to this task so we know you are working on it and move it to 
the "In Progress" column. Grab yourself a copy of the source code, create a new 
branch and push your masterpiece, once complete, back to GitHub to create a 
pull/merge request. 

After someone else reviewed/approved your code it will be merged back into the 
master branch.

If you are unable to/have no time to complete a task which you assigned to 
yourself be sure to put it back into the TODO list so someone else can pick
it up. 

Thanks for helping out!
